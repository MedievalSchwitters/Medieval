initialize local project from github repo:
    ~git clone <<insert copy pasted ssh from github>>
    Then, create new ide project from the folder that this generates. Do the above step in a bare terminal, not the ide

update local project from github repo
    ~git pull

update github repo from local project
    add all files to "staging area/commit zone"
        ~git add .
    consider "staging area/commit zone" complete and ready to push
        ~git commit -m"<<commit message(in quotes)>>"
    send changes to remote github repo
        ~git push (may have to set upstream branch if not already created; just copy paste the suggest command from terminal)

see which branch you're on
    ~git branch
create branch(better to do this in github)
    ~git branch <<branch name>>
change branch
    ~git checkout <<branch name>>
